			<p>First of all, it's good to try new things and activities such as the Banana boat!
			But if you're going on the Banana boat, you shouldn't get a baby on the Banana boat, because the baby can fall in the water and I don't think you'll want that to happen! Also when you're going on the Banana boat,hold onto the bars tightly and remember to take yourself a swimming costume so you don't get wet.
          Second, it's very hot so you shouldn't wear thick clothes or something that has long sleeves! But be careful because it rains almost every day here so bringing a jacket might be a good idea(the problem is that I forgot to bring my jacket so I can't go outside.)
          My opinion is that the ice cream labeled mix is the best one. Though I'm not sure completely because l've never tried the vanilla ice cream! 
          The glass boat is great and the part I like best is when you get to go into the water! </p>

			<h2> My last day at Dominican Republic, Punta Cana </h2>
			<img src="http://brazcomtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/punta-cana4.jpg">
			<p> I just woke up this morning, and I started writing this blog. My mom just asked the man if he had any coconut water to drink! You know now my mom loves coconut water (I hate it!) My baby sister said "sun????" And now she said "Sicifulladat ?????" and I have no idea what that means. But remember she's a baby! We got the coconut water I had to drink it so... "GROSS" ????
          It's my last day here and i'm very sad. ?? I'm sitting on the beach and I just finished my breakfast. My mom and dad are walking around the beach and I hope that I won't be scared. Last time I thought that my parents forgot about me. I'm still not sure where they are but I'm sure that they're looking at me. Good they're finally here. 
          After they got to me I went to play Volleyball in the sand! I would recommend that you play the game.
          Afterward I made a new friend. We made a sandcastle. Then we made a volcano and made it erupt on the city of Pompei! Then I came to my room and took a shower. Then I played video games on the iPad. I'm about to leave to eat lunch with my mom and dad. 
          The lunch is great! I ate two chocolate pancakes with chocolate syrup and pasta with shredded cheese and salsa. 
          I just came back from rock climbing! You're going to like it! I climbed up the same wall five times! I bought eight flowers home for my baby sister! 
          
          My dad is trying to put my baby sister to sleep but she's very naughty so she's not sleeping.
           I just finished dinner! You should try the spaghetti with meatballs but no meatballs if you don't eat beef! 
          I've just come back to my room and continued this blog. The train took us to our room. The train saves a lot of your energy so you don't have to walk all the way to your room. Goodbye, it's time for me to sleep now. I've had a great last day at Dominican Republic, Punta Cana! (That is putting aside that it's my last day here!)
